      <p>Evasioni Botaniche is a project that seeks to highlight our personal view of plants as active habitants of the botanical garden, seeking not to passively suffer the rules and order imposed by humans but to escape from it, seeking their own autonomous path. The photographic part is joined by parts of Alexander Supertramp's diary that make a connection between common will of  plants and human in modern society.<br> This project was made with <a class="cit" href="https://www.instagram.com/tobiafarinati/" target="_blank">Tobia Farinati</a> during the course of editorial design at ISIA U. </p></div>

    <div class="dida">Banzai was one of the first comic book stores in italy to devote itself completely to the world of manga and the culture of the Rising Sun. In this thesis project, I have elaborated a possible renewal of the identity of this Paduan comic institution, using as a founding concept the white space of comics. The project has been packed into a volume that is the same size as a tankobōn, a manga that usually collects chapters of a comic book already published in a magazine, creating a direct link with what this reality holds most dear.</div>

      <p>Insetti was born during the months of internship in <a class="cit" href="https://www.otium.tv/" target="_blank">Otium</a>. It is a visual research that wants to report almost all the bugs, especially the craziest ones, that have been generated in the span of five months in InDesign. This research comes from the desire to read in an antithetical way episodes normally perceived as problematic, elevating them to events worthy of stupor. The choice to transform this research into an editorial product underlines the antitheticity between anological medium and notes that are the result of a digital language.</p></div>

      <p>This fanzine is designed to reorder through a printed, physical and tangible medium, the ineffability of a dull, tiring, surreal and electrifying day of filming. The present moments were captured through the lens of an old camera with obvious infiltrations of light, which unintentionally described perfectly the atmosphere that could be felt. </p></div>

      <p>The project for the debut album of the Padua-based band Seville was born from the sense of randomness and melancholy that everyday life generates and that the group expresses within the record. It came spontaneously, therefore, my desire to visually capture their message, with a conscious process but one that would guarantee a result that was not entirely controllable. The use of acrylic color on acetate allowed me to represent this perfectly.</p></div>

The overlapping of multiple layers seeks a recall with the juxtaposition of different sonorities within the collection and a visual connection with the overlapping of the various layers in the ground, investigating in a possible graphic underground.</p></div>
