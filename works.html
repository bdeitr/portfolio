      <p>Fame da Lupi is a small editorial project that wants to encapsulate the madness of normality, the exaggeration of the little things. Taking pizza, very dear to me, as an object of research, its craziest toppings and the case of a man who has been eating only this dish for years, the project tries to bring back into a vernacular key the energy that a simple thing like pizza can give rise to, but underlining with an ironic and critical vein what the excess and overconsumption  can lead to.</p><p class="collab"> photos by <a class="cit" href="https://www.instagram.com/beatricevincenti_/" target="_blank">Beatrice Vincenti</a></p></div>

      <p>Evasioni Botaniche is a project that seeks to highlight our personal view of plants as active habitants of the botanical garden, seeking not to passively suffer the rules and order imposed by humans but to escape from it, seeking their own autonomous path. The photographic part is joined by parts of Alexander Supertramp's diary that make a connection between common will of  plants and human in modern society.<br> This project was made with <a class="cit" href="https://www.instagram.com/tobiafarinati/" target="_blank">Tobia Farinati</a> during the course of editorial design at ISIA U. </p></div>

    <div class="dida">Banzai was one of the first comic book stores in italy to devote itself completely to the world of manga and the culture of the Rising Sun. In this thesis project, I have elaborated a possible renewal of the identity of this Paduan comic institution, using as a founding concept the white space of comics. The project has been packed into a volume that is the same size as a tankobōn, a manga that usually collects chapters of a comic book already published in a magazine, creating a direct link with what this reality holds most dear.</div>

      <p>Insetti was born during the months of internship in <a class="cit" href="https://www.otium.tv/" target="_blank">Otium</a>. It is a visual research that wants to report almost all the bugs, especially the craziest ones, that have been generated in the span of five months in InDesign. This research comes from the desire to read in an antithetical way episodes normally perceived as problematic, elevating them to events worthy of stupor. The choice to transform this research into an editorial product underlines the antitheticity between anological medium and notes that are the result of a digital language.</p></div>

      <p>The project for the debut album of the Padua-based band Seville was born from the sense of randomness and melancholy that everyday life generates and that the group expresses within the record. It came spontaneously, therefore, my desire to visually capture their message, with a conscious process but one that would guarantee a result that was not entirely controllable. The use of acrylic color on acetate allowed me to represent this perfectly.</p></div>
